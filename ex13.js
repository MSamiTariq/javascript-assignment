// Your Own Array: Think of your favorite mode of transportation, such as a motorcycle or a car, and make a list that stores several examples. Use your list to print a series of statements about these items, such as “I would like to own a Honda motorcycle.”

var transportation = ["I would like to own a Honda motorcycle.", "I would like to own a Toyota Prius.", "I would like to own a Tesla Model S."];

for (let i = 0; i < transportation.length; i++) {
    console.log(transportation[i]);
}
