// Guest List: If you could invite anyone, living or deceased, to dinner, who would you invite? Make a list that includes at least three people youâ€™d like to invite to dinner. Then use your list to print a message to each person, inviting them to dinner.

var guest_list = ["Nelson Mandela", "Albert Einstein", "Martin Luther King Jr."];
var message = "I would like to invite you to dinner, ";
console.log(message + guest_list[0] + ".");
console.log(message + guest_list[1] + ".");
console.log(message + guest_list[2] + ".");
